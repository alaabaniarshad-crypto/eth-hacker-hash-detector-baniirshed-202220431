## 📌 Overview
This tool is designed to assist cybersecurity students and ethical hackers in quickly identifying common hash types based on their hexadecimal length. It also provides a utility to generate MD5 hashes from plaintext. The tool operates entirely using Python's standard library.

## ✨ Features
* **Hash Detection:** Automatically identifies MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 based on length.
* **MD5 Generator:** Securely converts plaintext strings into MD5 hash digests.
* **Dual Mode:** Supports both interactive menu and command-line arguments.
